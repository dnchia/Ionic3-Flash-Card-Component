# Flash card component in Ionic 3
This application is a demo to show the implementation of a flash card component.
Is usable in web and mobile environments, and could be used in Angular applications without any modification.

## How it works
All the implementation is done in a @Component that can be used anywhere inside the application.

## How to use it
The demo can be executed like any other Ionic application, using the Ionic CLI command: `ionic serve` to execute it in development mode.

## References
The original example was done following the tutorial made by Joshua Morony ([@joshuamorony](https://github.com/joshuamorony)) in
[Build a Custom Flash Card Component in Ionic 2 & 3](https://www.joshmorony.com/build-a-custom-flash-card-component-in-ionic-2/).

In this example the code has been modified to introduce the card text using @Input() directives.
Also, the background color of the back side has been changed too, to show that is easy to customize.
